                <h3 class="title2">About the Service</h3>
                <p class="text3">
                        For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise noted, all references to Justin Salcedo Web Development 
                        include justinsalcedo.com and Justin Salcedo. <br>
                        The Service provided begins strictly with a contract signed between Justin Salcedo Web Development (the Contractor) and the Client. The Contract remarks
                        these Terms and Clauses below.
                </p>
                <h3 class="title1">Ownership and Licenses</h3>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Client Owns All Work Product.</b>  As part of this job, Justin Salcedo is creating “work product” for the Client. To avoid confusion, work product 
                        is the finished product, as well as drafts, notes, materials, mockups, hardware, designs, inventions, patents, code, and anything else that the 
                        Contractor works on—that is, conceives, creates, designs, develops, invents, works on, or reduces to practice—as part of this project, whether before 
                        the date of the Contract or after. Justin Salcedo thereby gives the Client this work product once the Client pays for it in full. This means 
                        Justin Salcedo is giving the Client all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to the work product (including intellectual property rights), and the 
                        Client will be the sole owner of it. The Client can use the work product however it wants or it can decide not to use the work product at all. The 
                        Client, for example, can modify, destroy, or sell it, as it sees fit.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Contractor’s Use Of Work Product.</b> Once Justin Salcedo gives the work product to the Client, Justin Salcedo does not have any rights to it, except 
                        those that the Client explicitly gives Justin Salcedo by the Contract.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Contractor’s Help Securing Ownership.</b> In the future, the Client may need the Contractor’s help to show that the Client owns the work product or to 
                        complete the transfer. Justin Salcedo agrees to help with that. For example, Justin Salcedo may have to sign a patent application. The Client will 
                        pay any required expenses for this. If the Client can’t find Justin Salcedo, he (the Contractor) agrees that the Client can act on the Contractor’s behalf 
                        to accomplish the same thing. The following language gives the Client that right: if the Client can’t find Justin Salcedo after spending reasonable 
                        effort trying to do so, Justin Salcedo thereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Client as the Contractor’s agent and attorney-in-fact, which 
                        appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for Justin Salcedo and on this Contractor’s behalf to execute, verify, and file the required documents and 
                        to take any other legal action to accomplish the purposes of paragraph 'Client Owns All Work Product'. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Contractor’s IP That Is Not Work Product.</b> During the course of this project, Justin Salcedo might use intellectual property that Justin Salcedo owns or 
                        has licensed from a third party, but that does not qualify as “work product.” This is called “background IP.” Possible examples of background IP are 
                        pre-existing code, type fonts, properly-licensed stock photos, and web application tools. Justin Salcedo is not giving the Client this background IP. 
                        But, as part of the Contract, Justin Salcedo is giving the Client a right to use and license (with the right to sublicense) the background IP to develop, 
                        market, sell, and support the Client’s products and services. The Client may use this background IP worldwide and free of charge, but it cannot transfer 
                        its rights to the background IP (except as allowed in the Section 'Assignment'). The Client cannot sell or license the background IP separately from its 
                        products or services. Justin Salcedo cannot take back this grant, and this grant does not end when the Contract is over. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Contractor’s Right To Use Client IP.</b> Justin Salcedo may need to use the Client’s intellectual property to do its job. For example, if the Client is hiring 
                        Justin Salcedo to build a website, Justin Salcedo may have to use the Client’s logo. The Client agrees to let Justin Salcedo use the Client’s intellectual 
                        property and other intellectual property that the Client controls to the extent reasonably necessary to do the Contractor’s job. In addition, the Client 
                        allows Justin Salcedo to list the work product in its portfolio, as well as name the Client's brand for future testimonials and referrals. Beyond that, 
                        the Client is not giving Justin Salcedo any intellectual property rights, unless specifically stated otherwise in the Contract.
                </p>
                <h3 class="title1">Competitive Engagements</h3>
                <p class="text3">
                        Justin Salcedo won’t work for a competitor of the Client until the Contract ends. To avoid confusion, a competitor is any third party that develops, 
                        manufactures, promotes, sells, licenses, distributes, or provides products or services that are substantially similar to the Client’s products or services. 
                        A competitor is also a third party that plans to do any of those things. The one exception to this restriction is if Justin Salcedo asks for permission 
                        beforehand and the Client agrees to it in writing. If Justin Salcedo uses employees or subcontractors, Justin Salcedo must make sure they follow the 
                        obligations in this paragraph, as well. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="title1">Non-Solicitation</h3>
                <p class="text3">
                        Until the Contract ends, Justin Salcedo won’t: (a) encourage Client employees or service providers to stop working for the Client; (b) encourage Client 
                        customers or clients to stop doing business with the Client; or (c) hire anyone who worked for the Client over the 12-month period before the Contract ended. 
                        The one exception is if Justin Salcedo puts out a general ad and someone who happened to work for the Client responds. In that case, Justin Salcedo may hire 
                        that candidate. Justin Salcedo promises that it won’t do anything in this paragraph on behalf of itself or a third party. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="title1">Representations</h3>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Overview.</b> This section contains important promises between the parties.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Authority To Sign.</b> Each party promises to the other party that it has the authority to enter into the Contract and to perform all of its obligations 
                        under the Contract. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Contractor Has Right To Give Client Work Product.</b> Justin Salcedo promises that it owns the work product, that Justin Salcedo is able to give the work 
                        product to the Client, and that no other party will claim that it owns the work product. If Justin Salcedo uses employees or subcontractors, Justin Salcedo 
                        also promises that these employees and subcontractors have signed contracts with Justin Salcedo giving him any rights that the employees or 
                        subcontractors have related to the Contractor’s background IP and work product. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Contractor Will Comply With Laws.</b> Justin Salcedo promises that the manner it does this job, its work product, and any background IP it uses comply with 
                        applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Work Product Does Not Infringe.</b> Justin Salcedo promises that its work product does not and will not infringe on someone else’s intellectual property rights, 
                        that Justin Salcedo has the right to let the Client use the background IP, and that the Contract does not and will not violate any contract that  
                        Justin Salcedo has entered into or will enter into with someone else.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Client Will Review Work.</b> The Client promises to review the work product, to be reasonably available to Justin Salcedo if he (the Contractor) has questions regarding 
                        this project, and to provide timely feedback and decisions.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Client-Supplied Material Does Not Infringe.</b> If the Client provides Justin Salcedo with material to incorporate into the work product, the Client promises that this 
                        material does not infringe on someone else’s intellectual property rights. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="title1">Term and Termination</h3>
                <p class="text3">
                        The Contract is ongoing until the work is completed. Either party may end the Contract for any reason by sending an email or letter to the other party, 
                        informing the recipient that the sender is ending the Contract and that the Contract will end in 7 days. The Contract officially ends once that time has passed. 
                        The party that is ending the Contract must provide notice by taking the steps explained in Section 'Notices'. Justin Salcedo must immediately stop working as soon as it 
                        receives this notice, unless the notice says otherwise. The Client will pay Justin Salcedo for the work done up until when the Contract ends and will reimburse  
                        Justin Salcedo for any agreed-upon, non-cancellable expenses. The following sections don’t end even after the Contract ends: 'Ownership and Licenses'; 'Competitive 
                        Engagements'; 'Non-Solicitation'; 'Representations'; 'Confidential Information'; 'Limitation of Liability'; 'Indemnity'; and 'General'.
                </p>

                <p class="text3">

                        <b>The Client’s Confidential Information.</b> While working for the Client, Justin Salcedo may come across, or be given, Client information that is confidential. 
                        This is information like customer lists, business strategies, research & development notes, statistics about a website, and other information that is private. 
                        Justin Salcedo promises to treat this information as if it is the Contractor’s own confidential information. Justin Salcedo may use this information to do its 
                        job under the Contract, but not for anything else. For example, if the Client lets Justin Salcedo use a customer list to send out a newsletter, Justin Salcedo 
                        cannot use those email addresses for any other purpose. The one exception to this is if the Client gives Justin Salcedo written permission to use the information 
                        for another purpose, Justin Salcedo may use the information for that purpose, as well. When the Contract ends, Justin Salcedo must give back or destroy all 
                        confidential information, and confirm that it has done so. Justin Salcedo promises that it will not share confidential information with a third party, unless 
                        the Client gives Justin Salcedo written permission first. Justin Salcedo must continue to follow these obligations, even after the Contract ends. The Contractor’s 
                        responsibilities only stop if Justin Salcedo can show any of the following: (i) that the information was already public when Justin Salcedo came across it; (ii) 
                        the information became public after Justin Salcedo came across it, but not because of anything Justin Salcedo did or didn’t do; (iii) Justin Salcedo already knew 
                        the information when Justin Salcedo came across it and the Contractor didn’t have any obligation to keep it secret; (iv) a third party provided Justin Salcedo 
                        with the information without requiring that Justin Salcedo keep it a secret; or (v) Justin Salcedo created the information on its own, without using anything 
                        belonging to the Client.

                        <b>Third-Party Confidential Information.</b> It’s possible the Client and Justin Salcedo each have access to confidential information that belongs to third parties. 
                        The Client and Justin Salcedo each promise that it will not share with the other party confidential information that belongs to third parties, unless it is allowed 
                        to do so. If the Client or Justin Salcedo is allowed to share confidential information with the other party and does so, the sharing party promises to tell the other 
                        party in writing of any special restrictions regarding that information.

                        <b>Overview.</b> This section transfers certain risks between the parties if a third party sues or goes after the Client or Justin Salcedo or both. For example, 
                        if the Client gets sued for something that Justin Salcedo did, then Justin Salcedo may promise to come to the Client’s defense or to reimburse the Client for any losses.

                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Client Indemnity.</b> In the Contract, Justin Salcedo agrees to indemnify the Client (and its affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees, and 
                        agents) from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to a third-party claim or proceeding arising 
                        out of: (i) the work Justin Salcedo has done under the Contract; (ii) a breach by Justin Salcedo of its obligations under the Contract; or (iii) a breach by 
                        Justin Salcedo of the promises it is making in Section 'Representations'.

                        <b>Contractor Indemnity.</b> In the Contract, the Client agrees to indemnify Justin Salcedo (and its affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees, 
                        and agents) from and against liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to a third-party claim or proceeding arising 
                        out of a breach by the Client of its obligations under the Contract.

                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Assignment.</b> The Contract applies only to the Client and Justin Salcedo. Justin Salcedo cannot assign its rights or delegate its obligations under 
                        the Contract to a third-party (other than by will or intestate), without first receiving the Client’s written permission. In contrast, the Client may assign 
                        its rights and delegate its obligations under the Contract without the Contractor’s permission. This is necessary in case, for example, another Client buys out 
                        the Client or if the Client decides to sell the work product that results from the Contract.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Arbitration.</b> As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising under the Contract, a party may demand that 
                        the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Modification; Waiver.</b> To change anything in the Contract, the Client and Justin Salcedo must agree to that change in writing and sign a document showing 
                        their contract. Neither party can waive its rights under the Contract or release the other party from its obligations under the Contract, unless the waiving 
                        party acknowledges it is doing so in writing and signs a document that says so. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Notices</b><br/>(a) Over the course of the Contract, one party may need to send a notice to the other party. For the notice to be valid, it must be in 
                        writing and delivered in one of the following ways: personal delivery, email, or certified or registered mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested). 
                        The notice must be delivered to the party’s address listed at the end of the Contract or to another address that the party has provided in writing as an 
                        appropriate address to receive notice. <br/>
                        (b) The timing of when a notice is received can be very important. To avoid confusion, a valid notice is considered received as follows: (i) if delivered 
                        personally, it is considered received immediately; (ii) if delivered by email, it is considered received upon acknowledgement of receipt; (iii) if delivered 
                        by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), it is considered received upon receipt as indicated by the date on the signed receipt. <br/>
                        If a party refuses to accept notice or if notice cannot be delivered because of a change in address for which no notice was given, then it is considered received 
                        when the notice is rejected or unable to be delivered. If the notice is received after 5:00pm on a business day at the location specified in the address for that 
                        party, or on a day that is not a business day, then the notice is considered received at 9:00am on the next business day.

                        <b>Severability.</b> This section deals with what happens if a portion of the Contract is found to be unenforceable. If that’s the case, the unenforceable 
                        portion will be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that change is not permitted by law, in which case the portion will be 
                        disregarded. If any portion of the Contract is changed or disregarded because it is unenforceable, the rest of the Contract is still enforceable. 
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Signatures.</b> The Client and Justin Salcedo must sign the Contract using an e-signing system. These electronic signatures count as originals for all purposes.

                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Governing Law.</b> The laws of the state of California govern the rights and obligations of the Client and Justin Salcedo under the Contract, without regard to 
                        conflict of law principles of that state.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                        <b>Entire Contract.</b> The Contract represents the parties’ final and complete understanding of this job and the subject matter discussed in the Contract. The Contract 
                        supersedes all other contracts (both written and oral) between the parties.
